OK... how do we do this?


How it works now:
* ebug
* runs Devel::ebug::Console->new->run
* Console does Devel::ebug->new->program($file)->backend()->load
* backend ||= ebug_backend_perl
* uses Proc::Background to start backend, saves in $self->proc
* calls attach to connect to backend
* Does basic ping and tells he backend to give 'basic'
* Console enteres endless loop sending commands
* Each command blocks until backend responds

Backend:
* Runs a new perl with -d:ebug::Backend
* Contains actual DB:: routines
* DB::DB first calls initialize
* initialize opens listen socket, waits for connection
* Loads plugins
*
